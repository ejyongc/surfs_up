## Overview of the analysis: 

In this analysis we analyze weather data to provide our client with temperature information during the months of June and December in the island of Oahu. This analysis will help gage and determine the sustainability of a surf and ice cream business store all year-round.  

## Results: 

* The first results that we obtained from this analysis are the historic temperatures for the month of June. In the graph below we can see an *average* of 74.94 degrees with a *min* of 64 degrees and a *max* of 85 degrees. We can start determining that the warm weather conditions during the month of June are ideal to help drive business at a surf and ice cream store.

* The second result from this analysis shows the historic lowest, highest, adn average temperatures for the month of December. At first *minimum temperature* of 56 degrees can be seen as a downfall to the sustainability of the business during the month of December. Once we run a statistical analysis and plot that data we can see that those low temperatures are suspected to be anomalies (outliers) on our data that represents a low risk to a Surf shop & ice cream business.

* The third result we closely observe in this analysis is the overall fluctuation of the weather between what could be considered the peaks of two different seasons. Being 6 months apart from each other, the average temperatures during these two months only fluctuated -3.9 degrees. 

## Summary: 

In conclusion, the analysis performed on the historical temperature data for the Hawaiian island of Oahu, shows that the average temperature only fluctuated -3.9 degrees on a period of 6 months (December-June). 

In our opinion, the weather conditions on the island of Oahu, regardless of some inconsistent and sporadic high 50 degree days, are ideal to run an surf shop and ice cream business. 

Although this temperature analysis reveals important weather information that will contribute towards the decision making process of our client,  we should also advise to consider evaluating whether those two months carry heavy amounts of rain that could affect the volume of walk-in traffic at the store. In this additional analysis performed to the rain data we can observe an increment of almost 2 inches on the max ammount of rain during the month of December.
